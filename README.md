# byshell
This is my submission of a custom shell project for the OS course 2019/2020 at IUG.

It has some bugs:

	1- it can compile apps using gcc but won't run them. "easy fix"
  
	2- deletion of characters has a bug where if you delete from within the string you will delete a different character then what you intended. "not easy, but not hard to fix"
  
	3- pipes dont support arguments. "bit hard, but fixable"
  
If it helped you, try to improve on it and make a pull request.

Good luck!
